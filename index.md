## Realtime API

Playing games, chatting, accessing the AI review system, and many more features
relies on establishing a persistent WebSocket connection to the server and
exchanging messages.

The protocol is documented in the Goban project here:

[GobanSocket Realtime API documentation](/goban/modules/protocol.html)

## REST API

Creating challenges, adding friends, joining tournaments and ladders, loading tsumego,
and many more features are done via REST calls to the REST API.

The REST API documentation is a work in progress.
